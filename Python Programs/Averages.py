second_number = input("Enter the second number: ")
# Convert that into a floating point number
second_number = float(second_number)

# Get the third number
third_number = input("Enter the third number: ")
# Convert that into a floating point number
third_number = float(third_number)

# Get the average of the three numbers and print it
